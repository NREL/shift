Getting free distribution feeder models for your reasearch has never been easier.
SHIFT helps you build synthetic distribution feeders models using just the OpenStreet data e.g. buildings and road network. You can configure lots of
parameters and design choices when building these models and even create multiple versions of them and choose the one that fits your needs. If you are utility no worries we 
have you covered as well. As a utility you can also integrate your data when building these models. 

Having distribution models in your hand can help you perform rich analysis in understanding impact of distributed energy resources 
such as roof top PV, energy storage (Tesla Wall, lead acid, lithium name ....), electric vehicle and more. Performing network upgrade analysis, hosting capacity 
analysis, interconnection studies all require detailed distribution models.

So what are you waiting for. We can't wait to see how you will use this tool for your as wells your organizations's benefit.
